Embur's Halloween

Colors - Orange, Purple, Red  
  

The Nox Unda tends to be more active during October, though many aren't sure whether it's actually true or people are just feeding off of fear.

One thing to note for sure, never go out alone at night during Nightwave. Or else you may be, the next disappearance victim.

Generally regions use masks, costumes, or a combo of both. Said to "hide themselves from Nox Unda or bad luck".
