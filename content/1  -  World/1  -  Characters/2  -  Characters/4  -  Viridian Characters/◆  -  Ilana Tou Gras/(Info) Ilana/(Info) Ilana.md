**Bio**

One of the closest connections to Terraine. 


**Strengths / Weaknesses**

A lot of outsiders may say their strength, but locals know that Ilana's greatest strength is their devotion for their people.  
However they may struggle sometimes with understanding beings, such as "why they do this or that", but locals often help out with that.

**Hobbies**

Outside of official duties, Ilana's hobbies include:
- Taking care of their personal garden.
- Listening to stories. Both from their people and outsiders.


**Additional Notes**

Scutum is Viridian's title for "Leader".

Ilana is the only being to both have the abilities to fight and heal. 
For other beings they either can have fighting capabilities or heal others. Beings usually can't have both.
