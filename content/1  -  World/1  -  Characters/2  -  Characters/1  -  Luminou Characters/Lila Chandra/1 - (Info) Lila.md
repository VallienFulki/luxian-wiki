**Bio**

If you wonder around Luminou during Late Night, you may have a chance of encountering the Lone Star of Night Sky.
Legends say she has been slaying Nox Unda for many years as a form of "redemption".

Often shops are closed at midnight, so shop owners tend to leave out stuff for Lila as a form of a thank you.
She doesn't feel deserving of these gifts, but still appreciates them.
