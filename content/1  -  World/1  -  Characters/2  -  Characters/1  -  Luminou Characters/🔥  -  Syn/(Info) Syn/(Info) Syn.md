**Bio**

Team Phoenix Ignition's most powerful buffer/debuffer!
Syn's talents with alchemy often helps the team during desperate times. Better hope they threw the right unlabeled potion!


**Strengths / Weaknesses**

Syn's greatest strength is of course their alchemy skills. 
Their communication skills are not so bright though. Often what they want to do gets priority, and they have a hard time expressing their true feelings towards others.


**Hobbies**

Alchemy! Always Alchemy.
