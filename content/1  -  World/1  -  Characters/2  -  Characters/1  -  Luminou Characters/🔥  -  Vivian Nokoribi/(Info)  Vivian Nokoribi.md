##### Bio

Despite being through a lot, her burning smile will never snuff out.

Previously she was known to be cold, refusing to think that she can't find light again. Until Zalika and her team showed her the opposite.

Nowadays, she's intelligent, playful, and caring. With the warm smile she carries, as more and more people find a light during their dark times because of her. It sounds, familiar to a certain Knight related to the Sun.
