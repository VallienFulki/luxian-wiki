##### Bio

According to the Locals of Luminou, they often think of her as a Flying Star. She visits Locals once in a while, but brings warmth from her presence.
Lumi's upbeat personality brightens the Locals' moods, which also is why the Locals of Luminou are often known as friendly.


##### Strengths / Weaknesses

Lumi is known for her radiant personality outside of her official duties.
Sometimes she goes off track of her schedule with helping people out, and even a bit of slacking off.


##### Hobbies

- Painting
- Stained Glass Making
- Sometimes getting drunk
- Reading
- Spending time with locals


##### Additional Notes

The first Chief of Lumen Knights was supposed to be Lux Solaris but they gave the title to Lumi instead, knowing that she would perform well. Possibly even better than Lux.
