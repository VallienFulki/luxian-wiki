**Intro**
"Greetings! I'm Elina Florethorn of Crimson Scythe. I hear you have business with me?"

**About - Rozan**
"Aw my cute lil bro! I heard he grew up so fast, having a partner while working for the Lumen Knights.
I'm sure his skills are badass by now, I wish to see it one day."

**About - Family**
"My work often chains me to shifts, I often don't have the luxury to visit.
I do miss the sweet scent of flowers at home."

**Motive**
"Everyone has somethin to fight for!
I will fight until a vampire drains me."
