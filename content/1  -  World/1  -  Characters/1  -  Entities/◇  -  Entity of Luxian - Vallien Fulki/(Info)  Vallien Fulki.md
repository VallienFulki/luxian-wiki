##### Bio

ERROR: Hidden Data Not Present In Luxian

All things start from at least somewhere. This entity abandoned a home planet named Earth to make his own home, a place with actual hope.

After using a lot of ME to make it happen he rests under a tree for many, many years.

----

V-KI mainly uses his powers to make sure Luxian does not fall from imbalance, and to be protected from threats that are not from this world.
Many won't know his identity, however keeping this world turning is good enough.
