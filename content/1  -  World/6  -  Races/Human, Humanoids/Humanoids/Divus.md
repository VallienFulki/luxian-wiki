##### Intro

Divus are ancient beings formed by Terraine's Eneri Magia.
They are likely the origin of how non Magia Essere gained EM Aptitude and Element abilities.

Due to their strength + long lifespan, the Divus population is one of the lowest in the world.


##### Features

Body Ratio: 100% ME

Born "Genderless". 
They can "change into a gender" with magic, mainly to either experience being more like a "human", or "blending in" more with humanoids.


##### Strengths / Weaknesses

Due to their 100% ME Body Ratio, their magic abilities are known to be the best in Luxian.

However they can be easily killed if their ability to use magic is completely cut off.
