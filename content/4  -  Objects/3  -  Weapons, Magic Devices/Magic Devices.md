##### Spelltome

The grimoires of Luxian, used to store and cast spells.

###### Spelltome (Neo Skyline)

Spelltomes in Neo Skyline works more like a vessel to use Spell Data with.
The Cartridge/Disk System is the one that stores the spells, not the Spelltome.

##### Staff

The magic wands of Luxian, with the core being the main feature of the device.

###### Staff (Spell Wand Mode)

Used like a Spelltome, to cast spells easier.

###### Staff (Spell Blade Mode)

The user can summon a blade made of magic above the core.


##### Cartridge/Disk System

Mainly used to store spells in Neo Skyline.
A weapon or a magic device (Spelltome or Staff) is required to use this system, Cartridges/Disks cannot be used alone.

###### Cartridges

Feeling retro? These things can't hold a lot of Spell Data, but they're tougher than disks due to its shell cover.
What keeps them from being lost to time are people's nostalgia for them. Some people even still make them today!

###### Disks

The successor of Cartridges, able to hold more Spell Data.
If not careful enough, you could lose the data if the disk gets shattered!
