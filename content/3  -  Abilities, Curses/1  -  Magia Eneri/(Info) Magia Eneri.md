**Core System**
Magia Eneri (ME) is a type of Energy that is the Life Source, and Magic System for ME Users.

ME Capacity is how much ME a User can store. This also can depend on their Aptitude.

All life has at least a bit of Eneri Magia genes. 
However, some races/species may not have the capability to be born as an ME User. Instead they would be born with Bio Eneri.


**Requirements**

Any Non ME User can become an ME User if they have enough Aptitude.

Aptitude is a combination of Genetics and Mental Strength.



**Biological Changes / Impact**

Due to the heavy impact ME can have on a body, if the Non ME User does not have enough Aptitude: ME will painfully kill them during the process of gaining ME.

When becoming an ME User, Eneri Magia completely replaces their Bio Eneri. 
With this change the user doesn't need to eat anymore, but they still need to sleep properly.
If they don't get enough sleep it can severely impact their body's performance.

ME Users also has the capability to live longer than Non ME Users, around 200+ years.



**Using EM for Magic**

There are multiple ways to cast magic:
- Using a body part (Arm, Hand, Head, Whole Body, etc.)
- Using objects (Scrolls, Crystals, Staffs, Rocks, etc.)
- Using a weapon

In Embur, ME Capacity is the limit to magic. Like technology spells are invented using knowledge, and experimentation.



**Limitations**

As mentioned before, If an ME User doesn't get enough sleep it can severely impact their body's performance.
ME Users can use drinks/potions to refill some of their ME, but it's never an optimal replacement for sleep.

Depending on how big/frequent spells are, it may drain ME faster.



**Alterations**

Like biology, some ME Users may have slightly different magic from others.

For example if an ME User has a passionate personality, there's a chance their magic may resonate with the Fire element.
