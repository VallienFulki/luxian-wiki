**Core System**

Nox Unda is a force of Corrupt Eneri Magia, negatively impacting those who are affected in various ways.


**Nox Unda Corruptions**

**Full Corruption**
Takes over the being's body. The being is now just a vessel for the Nox Unda, no longer themself.

**Half Corruption** 
Person has control over mind and body but still has high risk for full corruption.
Has a chance of branching depending on the corruption. (EX: Vampires are made by drinking corrupted blood)

**Partial Corruption** 
The being would mostly be fine as long as they are medically treated.
The most risk of Partial Corruption is losing functionality of body parts depending on where the being was hit. 


**Limitations**

Nox Unda can be easily detected in detail by experienced EM Users.
Non experienced EM Users may sense that something is off.



**Alterations**

Like EM, Nox Unda can branch off in various ways.
